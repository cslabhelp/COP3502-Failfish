## Overview
This assignment is intended to teach you to use a circular doubly-linked list and its queue.
## Details
Failfish are small monsters that eat only other Failfish. This makes them ecologically and practically useless, causingmany small monster scholars to wonder how they ever came to exist in the first place. 

They are delicious, which is a plus, but since they eat each other, they're almost impossible to farm.That doesn't keeppeople from trying. It keeps them from succeeding, but not from trying.

You have been hired by an ambitious small monster farmer to record their attempts to farm Failfish.

The farmer has:
- Ten Failfish ponds arranged one after the other.
   - Each pond has a name, and also a sequence number from 1 to 10.
- 𝐺 groups of Failfish that they've captured. Groups of Failfish are called Failgroups. They were called Failschools once, but small monster scholars determined that Failfish are unable to learn.
   - Each Failgroup𝑔𝑖has𝑛𝑖Failfish in it, with 𝑛𝑖≥ 2.Note that𝑖is thepond number–the Failfish don’thave to be in ponds1. . 𝐺.
   - Each Failfish in a Failgroup is branded with a sequence number, from 1 to 𝑛𝑖.
     - Modern small monster farming methods being humane, the branding is done with aparticularly waterproof marker. No Failfish are harmed during modern Failfish farming. (Except when they get eaten.)
